            <strong>Call for Stories!</strong> Ever since the graduation of the pioneer class, the number of success stories of Jacobs alumni has been in an exponential growth! We know this, the university leadership know this, and the extended friends of the university know this. We believe these stories must be shared with an even wider community. And more importantly, you also believe that this is an area of tremendous importance for the future of the university: in the needs survey of 2013, you pointed out that increasing the reputation of Jacobs is of the highest importance – higher than providing financial support, higher than being involved in career advancement or than finding ways to (re-)connect with friends. Each one of you carries a story of struggles and success – a story that begins with the first moment that set you on a path to Jacobs and continues with where you are on your path right now. These stories deserve to be shared! We call upon you to demystify what makes Jacobs an educational compass for the next century! Who amongst your friends from our alma mater has an interesting story regarding who they are, where they came from and what they have achieved so far? Who has made unprecedented turns? Who has been empowered by their experiences at Jacobs? Whose story deserves to be on the pages of Weserkurrier instead of what we usually read there about Jacobs? What has your story been? We strongly encourage self-nominations as well as multiple nominations of friends! Send us the nomination including nominee’s name and their story in 5-10 sentences. After review, nominees will be contacted for a further discussion.

            <strong>Alumni Consulting Initiative – Update!</strong> In the course of the last weeks a lot has happened around the Alumni Consulting Initiative (ACI). A quick recall: After the General Assembly during last year’s Homecoming a group of alumni volunteered to offer Jacobs University support with the restructuring of the university towards a long-term sustainable future. In mid- February the Board of Governors, at the request of the Alumni Board, announced its support for this initiative. Since then, roughly 20 alumni have signed-up for the ACI expert pool from which suitable alumni consultants with topic-specific expertise are supporting the agreedupon initiatives. The university leadership and the ACI coordinators – Axel Domeyer (‘06), Jan-Dirk Früchtenicht (‘05) and Henrik Maedler (’07) – have so far identified two areas where the initiative can assist the ongoing change process at Jacobs University: student marketing and tuition financing models. A small team of alumni with relevant expertise has already conducted a first meeting with the university administration to kick off the student marketing project. The ideas suggested were welcomed with noticeable enthusiasm and great openness by the university leadership. The goal of this project will be to develop a comprehensive student marketing strategy, which balances out the financial aims of the university with the goal to preserve the diversity of the student body. The alumni involved are currently drafting the initiative’s work streams, deliverables and project planning. For the project on tuition financing models, the ACI coordinators are currently identifying suitable alumni from the ACI expert pool to prepare a work plan and start consultations with the university. The focus of this project will be to address problems with student loan repayment and investigate new models for tuition financing that could complement the existing financial aid mix. These steps are a great foundation but more alumni are needed to join these and future projects to help the change process of Jacobs University. If you are willing to join the ACI expert pool, please contact one of the ACI coordinators via Almalink, LinkedIn, Facebook or: <a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="mailto:jd.fruechtenicht@gmail.com">jd.fruechtenicht@gmail.com</a>, <a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="mailto:axeldomeyer@gmail.com">axeldomeyer@gmail.com</a>, <a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="mailto:henrik.maedler@gmail.com">henrik.maedler@gmail.com</a>

The Lotos Club is among New York’s oldest and most storied institutions. Founded in 1870 by a young group of writers and critics, Mark Twain, an early member, called it the “Ace of Clubs.” The Lotos Club has always had a literary and artistic bent, with the result that it has accumulated a noted collection of American paintings, including work by Charles Henry Miller, E. Irving Couse, Adolfo Müller-Ury, Carleton Wiggins, and Zenos Frudakis. Its state dinners are legendary conventions of scholars, artists and sculptors, collectors and connoisseurs, writers, and journalists. It is our honor and pleasure that the Jacobs University Foundation, too, has the opportunity to host our event here with special thanks to a friend of the university, a Lotus Club member himself. Welcome Reception 6.30pm Dinner &amp; Keynote 7.30pm Alumni and friends from around the world are all welcome! Please join in for what should be a very fun and memorable night! Reserve your seat(s) now – Space is limited! We urge all to buy their dinner tickets at the event page below – $65 per person:<a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="http://www.jacobs-university-foundation.org/events/nyc2014.html">http://www.jacobs-university-foundation.org/events/nyc2014.html</a> We look forward to seeing you again soon!

            <strong>Facing the World after Graduating in ISS</strong> On 15 February 2014, alumna Shinta Harsana (ISS 2010) came all the way from Berlin, the social science capital of central Europe, to introduce her allegedly ‘messy’ CV. More than 20 undergraduate students out of which all pursue a degree at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (SHSS) joined her and followed her journey through multiple countries and institutions ever since she graduated from Jacobs University Bremen (JUB) with a Bachelor’s degree in ISS. “I can highly recommend you to continue studying after graduating from this university. It is tougher to go back to school after having worked for some time,” Shinta said. Following her own advice, she completed a one-year Master’s degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) nonstop after having graduated from JUB. Step by step, Shinta told the attending students how she worked her way through nonprofit organizations like Ashoka: Innovators for the Public and highly commercial companies such as the GFA Consulting Group. She concluded that wherever she went she would be missing Berlin a lot. And this is how she ended up working as a Research Analyst for the Berlin office of Renovata Partners, an executive search firm for companies in the IT sector. In her inspiring presentation, Shinta made clear how easy it can be for ISS students to pursue a career beyond academia which they can enjoy and which offers freedom to personal and professional development. Once again, thank you for coming!

            <strong>The Future is Here!</strong> “The year is 2025. You have reached some major goals in your life, as you rocked your way to personal success, despite downfalls you may have experienced in-between. Maybe you are half a step away from your next promotion. Maybe your family has grown all the way to the doggy door at the kitchen, and your health is admirable for someone in the midst of their lifespan. Possibly, you are working in your dream job. You might have grown personally thanks to friends, family, a therapist, or thanks to a change in your career path. It might be that you are well-respected by your peers at work: your colleagues secretly admire you for your contacts, for your multidisciplinary understanding of the work, for your unbarring pursuit of the “different perspective”, for your foresight and intuition in speaking to the customers in the opposite time-zone (and to the ones down the street), and for your transcendence of Yoda into linguistically sound advice. In essence, you are on top of your game. “You fondly think from time to time about the place that shaped the better version of who you came to be. Your pride makes you an ambassador – a custodian of Jacobs: • You mentor 2 students, navigating through their internships and their first job experiences. • You are now part of a 10,000-strong network that inspires. • You are part of a thriving Alumni community – an advisory organization to the University, on eye-to-eye level with the Foundation. • You are interacting through a platform with all contributors – Admissions, Career Services, businesses and non-government organizations, host families and donors. • You know perfectly well the value of giving back, and you do! – you were, after all, the Alumni Scholarship recipient in 2010. “You are a custodian of the moral and intellectual stand of the Jacobs spirit!” ! This is our aspiration – it is the path(ology) of a Jacobian. We are taking steps to ensure your and our custodian rights! That’s why we are announcing Alma Link 2.0! With feedback collected over the past two years from the alumni, student body, and Jacobs, we compiled product criteria, technical limitations and specifications, benefits and desired experiences, and execution timeline. And work has begun!! Custodians apply here for beta-testing!

            <strong>BRIMUN – Call for Donations</strong> I am writing to you today on behalf of the Bremen International Model United Nations team. As you would know, this is a yearly conference at JUB and this year we are hosting the 10th anniversary! This years arrangements are going well and we are quite excited to be hosting delegates from across Germany and Europe to our campus over Spring Break. Despite its comparably short history, BRIMUN has welcomed participants all over the world. The conference was founded in 2003 in hope of encouraging today’s youth to become politically engaged. The conference emulates an identical framework to that of the United Nations, with our primary objective to develop open-minded students who are passionate about the issues that our world faces today. Our conference is ideal for fostering sophisticated debate, while still providing less experienced delegates with the opportunity to mature and gain insight on UN proceedings and topics. As organiser, we are always looking to actively involve Alumni. Helping either through donations, contacts, or any other method would would go a long way in helping our conference establish itself and to allow it to create a link with the Jacobs alumni and the community. If you are interested in offering a helping hand, please do not hesitate to stay in touch, via <a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="mailto:y.hammadi@jacobs-university.de">y.hammadi@jacobs-university.de</a>. For donations to support this event, please visit the following link. <a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="/make-your-gift">http://www.https://jacobs-alumni.de//make-your-gift!</a> Please use the following intended purpose when making the transaction: BRIMUN 2014
