        Dear fellow alumni,
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past months we have been working really hard to bring relevant IT services to Jacobs Alumni. In the last General Assembly meeting, in September 2014, it was suggested by an Alumnus to use Google Apps for Education instead of our email server, and the idea received a lot of support from the Alumni in the room. Today, we are excited to tell you that we have successfully reached an agreement to use Google Apps for Education, and are additionally migrating our current infrastructure to more powerful servers owned by the Alumni Association in a private datacenter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shift in infrastructure will allow the Alumni Association to provide top notch services which are needed to be able to keep our Alumni connected. We believe that a powerful platform and great Email experience will help strengthen our network in reach and awareness. The new Alumni Email, powered by Google, will give you all the features that you expect from an email account and we hope to see many of you using it as your primary account. Furthermore, it comes with unlimited of storage (compared to the 200MB that we currently offer), a very powerful calendar, seamless integration with mobile devices, centralized protection against spamming and viruses and high availability. We will also have full access to the Docs suite and other Google services you already might be familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to stress that Google Apps for Education has a different privacy policy than the one for commercial services. Full ownership of the data remains within the alumni association. It goes without saying that, unlike the regular Google accounts there are no Ads nor any other data collecting services scanning your emails (you can read the full privacy agreement <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/trust/">here</a>). All personal data collected by the Alumni through surveys, Almalink and its own network, will be stored securely in our private data servers in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are very happy to provide you with all these services and are working very hard to make this happen. We understand that some of you might have concerns, and we will be glad to answer any questions you might have via Twitter, Facebook or Email. Please check our FAQ page on <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> and let us know if you have any questions via dgarcia@jacobs-alumni.de.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the upcoming weeks, we will provide you with all the information you need to know about the migration process. We hope that you are as excited as we are about this news, and would certainly love to hear more suggestions like this one from you in the future.

        The Alumni Board will meet again in person in Zurich, Switzerland, on the weekend of 10th – 12th April 2015. The reason for choosing the Swiss city is not that we love seeing how few Swiss Francs for the Euro one gets these days, but that Stefan Rustler, the new Assessor – Events, and Elena Isac, the new Assessor – Special Projects are currently living there and they were nice enough to arrange some meeting space for the rest of the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
        We plan to discuss the latest updates on board projects like the switch from Alumni Scholarships to the Generation Fund, the further development and integration of AlmaLink services, and settle important details for Homecoming in September.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, we love meeting up with local alumni. So, together with the Alumni Chapter Zurich, we will organize an event on Saturday night that everyone can join. So, if you’re in the city on Saturday and want to talk to the Alumni Board, we would be happy to meet you there!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if you’re concerned about a particular topic and would like the board to discuss it on the weekend, please get in touch with Stefan at <a href="mailto:sanca@jacobs-alumni.de">sanca@jacobs-alumni.de</a>.

      <p>
        Mark your calendars and save the date if you have not done so yet: This year’s Homecoming happens on September 25 – 27. The Homecoming Organization Committee (HOC) has been established with the Class Representatives of the anniversary classes, Suna Turhan (’10) and Neil Dsouza (’05), as well as Stefan Rustler (’12) as board member and new Assessor for Events taking the lead.

      </figure>
      <p>
        The HOC has already started working and brainstorming on how to make Homecoming 2015 even more memorable. Much feedback was expressed last year and we are confident to build upon the successes and lessons learned of the previous Homecomings. One of those successes was the Career Symposium on Friday, a series of company presentations of alumni to current students, which we plan to also have this year. Furthermore, we are aiming at integrating current students better into the event. Homecoming 2015 will certainly be a chance to not only renew old bonds but to also build new ones!

        The Alumni Board’s efforts to establish the association as a self-sufficient and financially independent institution has received strong support from within the association. The Alumni Fees Initiative (AFI)  is a group of almost 30 alumni from various majors and graduating classes. The goal of this initiative is the introduction of a sustainable membership model that allows for free services enabling trusted networking while facilitating financial contributions as an opportunity to give back and support.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently evaluating our crowdsourced feedback and will share the results for further discussion and fine-tuning. Should you still be interested in partaking in the process or have any questions, please get in touch with Peter or Suna from the Alumni Board. Expect further news on Alumni Fees soon!

      <p>
        The student organizers of the Women’s International Leadership (WIL) Conference would like to extend a warm invitation to the Jacobs University alumni community to attend the first annual WIL conference. The conference will take place on campus during the weekend of April 17th - 19th and will feature workshops, speeches and networking opportunities for students and graduates alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        WIL is a solely student-led initiative conceptualized by young women aged between 18 and 22, hailing from diverse backgrounds such as Indonesia, Czech Republic, and Zimbabwe. As women of the millennial generation, the WIL team is passionate and united in its goal to make a difference in women’s leadership of the 21st century.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/media/newsletters/2015-03/march4.jpg" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        The goal of the conference is to share experiences and visions regarding individual career paths, current developments in the workplace and especially the future of women’s leadership. The intensive two-day event will explore the issues of female representation in politics and development, business and management and science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM). The conference will provide participants of all genders the tools they need to better understand and ultimately eliminate the barriers to female workforce representation. WIL is not only about, but in itself a step towards more women’s leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference offers something for everyone, and confirmed speakers include Professor Uta Paskowski of the University of Cambridge, who will speak about her experiences balancing career and family in academia. Alice Bentinck of Entrepreneur First, will also attend the conference and speak about female-led start ups and how to improve female representation in the tech industry. Siana Bangura, self-proclaimed Black Feminist and founder of <em>No Fly on the WALL</em>, an intersectional Feminist blog, will speak about damaging stereotypes of women in the workplace. Helga Truepel, a German Green Party politician and member of the European Parliament, will speak about her experiences and work as a deputy. Last but not least, Andrea Cordes of UN Women will introduce the UN Resolution 1325 – Women, Peace, and Security.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the WIL Conference will provide a diverse set of Workshops on women’s leadership in business, basic concepts of cloud computing as well as scenario-based career planning. Jacobs alumni will offer a workshop on “Introduction to Web Development.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Alumni are welcome to participate in both days of the conference and are encouraged to represent themselves and/or their employer at our networking brunch on Sunday morning. During the networking brunch, participants will have the opportunity to establish contacts within their fields of interest. We are particularly interested in hearing from our wonderful Jacobs University alumnae and would very much appreciate their presence at this brunch.

      </figure>
      <p>
        After graduating from Jacobs with a BSc in Earth and Space Sciences, Eduardo pursued a Master of Science in Geology and Geochemistry at the University of Freiburg. Having worked on an environmental assessment project of a mine in Vietnam and exploring Mexico’s main mining states as an Industry Analyst at the Mexico Mining Review, he decided to pursue a career in environmental consulting for the mining industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Current location:</strong> Queretaro, Mexico
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Nationality:</strong> Mexican
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Job title:</strong> Staff Consultant (Geochemist)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Current employer:</strong> <a href="http://www.srk.com/en">SRK Consulting</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tell us about your current occupation, responsibilities and what you like most about it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently employed by SRK Consulting, one of the main mining consulting firms in the world. My responsibilities include geochemistry and hydrogeology field work at mine sites in Mexico, and support work for the SRK North American and South American operations. I like that I am able to use both my scientific knowledge which I acquired throughout my studies in Germany and my business knowledge which I acquired after working on the business publication Mexico Mining Review.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What was your journey since you graduated from Jacobs, in regards to what you are doing now?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After Jacobs, I felt like I wanted to dig deeper into geochemistry, and so I decided to go to Freiburg where I was accepted in a master program and in a geochemistry research group. During the two years in Freiburg, I was able not only to expand my theoretical understanding of geochemistry but was also given the opportunity to do some hands-on research work on the environmental impact of coal mining in Vietnam. Coming back to Mexico, I took a job as an industry analyst in the Mexico Mining Review team, which took me all over Mexico to meet the leaders of the country’s mining industry. It was through this job that I truly began to understand mining, and realized that I wanted to do environmental consulting for the extractive industries. The job with SRK Consulting is an ideal step in my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I heard you moved back to your home country. Any thoughts you want to share about the transition and returning back home?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I won’t try to generalize my experience since every country and every person is different. However, I will say that coming back to Mexico was the best choice that I could have made personally and professionally. I left Mexico when I was 18 years old and did not move back until I was 24. Coming back to live in Mexico as a young adult allowed me to see the true aspect of my home country.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Looking back, what do you miss most about Jacobs?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss hanging out with my friends from Jacobs, the weekend trips to Berlin, and movie nights with my Canadian roommate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What advice would you give to current Jacobs students?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Make the most out of the Jacobs experience, both academically and personally. Look to your professors for help whenever you are stuck academically, and try to visit downtown Bremen at least once a week. Also, learn German if you are not German! It is important to be able to communicate with the local population of the country where you live.
      </p>
