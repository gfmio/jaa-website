        The Homecoming Organization Committee is excited to welcome you for this year’s <strong>Homecoming from 22nd – 24th of September</strong> on campus. The Class Representatives of 2007 and 2012, Stefan Rustler and Henrik Maedler along with the organization team consisting of Lida, Diana, Adriana, Hasan, Devashish, Alex, Max, Flo and Max are working hard towards making this yet another memorable event for all Alumni “coming home”.

        Many things will be the like the previous year, most notably the combination of Homecoming with the <strong>Symposium</strong> on Friday and the <strong>Jacobs Games (formerly Olympix)</strong>. We are excited to host <strong>this year’s Reunion Dinner at Jacobs University in the Campus Center’s East Wing</strong> – Prof. Treusch and Prof. Hülsmann have already confirmed their attendance. Like last year, the dinner will be open to all Alumni, regardless of their graduating class. We are also very excited to move the <strong>Alumni Association Assembly to Saturday Afternoon</strong> – allowing all of us to enjoy a calm Saturday Morning on campus and be well rested for the <strong>Homecoming party on Saturday Night</strong>. Alex, Max, Devashish and Flo are working hard to make sure that the night will be a match for the best parties the campus has seen.

        <strong>The ticket sales will be opened in June.</strong> There will be three ticket options – from the full package to the basic ticket for just a few Euros. Unfortunately there will be no room to stay on campus this year (oh no!) because of a very strong incoming class of 2020 (yay!). The Alumni Office will support us with blocking room contingents at local hotels, though, to make sure everyone finds a place to stay. To purchase tickets, <strong>make sure you have access to your jacobs-alumni account!</strong> If you run into any trouble, contact our <a href="mailto:support@jacobs-alumni.de">IT-volunteers</a>.

        We will be in touch with more information, like a detailed agenda and  as soon as possible. For other inquiries, suggestions and feedback, please get in touch with the <a href="mailto:hoc@jacobs-alumni.de">Homecoming Organization Committee</a>. We want to make this event for <strong>you</strong>!
