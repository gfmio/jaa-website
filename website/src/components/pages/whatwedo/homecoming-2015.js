        The Homecoming Organization Committee can’t wait to see you for <strong>Homecoming from 25<sup>th</sup> – 27<sup>th</sup> of September</strong> on campus. And we are sure many of your former classmates can’t wait either: For the second time two classes, 2005 and 2010, are going to celebrate their 10th, and respectively, 5th anniversary. With Alexander, Amy, Devashish, Jan-Dirk, Julia, Kiran, Neil, Nitin, Ralina, Razvan, Stefan, Stefy, Suna, and Tasaffy we have a committed team to bring a most memorable event this fall.

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>I am not part of Class of 2005 or 2010. Can I still join the event?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Absolutely! Homecoming is an event for all Jacobs alumni – and their partners. That includes recent graduates and also exchange students. The major difference for the anniversary class is that they will have a formal dinner on Saturday evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can I bring my partner and my kids?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are aiming to make this year’s Homecoming family-friendly. So of course you can register your partner with the event. Just purchase two appropriate tickets in the shop at the bottom. During the General Assembly, to which all alumni are invited, campus tours will be offered for non-alumni, i.e. partners and friends. Furthermore, there will be a free child care option – “Jacobs Kids” the kindergarten on campus – available upon request. To make sure your partner and/or child is/are properly registered with everything, fill out the information under “Additional Information” in the checkout step during the registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What’s this year’s theme?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        With this year’s theme “Then and Now” we would like to take the chance to bring back memories from old times on campus, either as an IUB or as a Jacobs student: Attend lectures with your old professors, join the formal dinner – this year on campus, and party it up with students and alumni alike. However, the theme also wants to recognize the current times: Join the Career Symposium, get first-hand updates from the university, and simply catch up with the many alumni. Nostalgia for the past and appreciation of the present – Homecoming 2015 will have it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Will there be any sports activities?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are lucky to have Olympix – now “Jacobs Games” – taking place on the same weekend as Homecoming. Alumni are invited to join the “graduate teams” and be once again part of this crazy competition. Drop an e-mail to <a href="mailto:sullrich@jacobs-alumni.de">Stefy</a> (Class of 2010) to if you are interested. The sports event is only complete with a grand party on Saturday night. For this current and former members of TheOtherSide are teaming up to present to you the theme party “From Athens to Rio”. This will also be a tribute to the class of 2005, which started TheOtherSide and brought theme parties to campus.
      </p>

      <p>

Furthermore, for the first time ever registrations and payments will be handled directly by the Alumni Association on the online shop at the bottom of this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I purchase meals on campus without the “Campus All-In”-option?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Only the “Campus All-In” ticket option, i.e. accommodation on campus, comes with full board in the serveries. The other two ticket options, “Anniversary Special + Events” and “Events Only”, only include the “Chill &amp; Grill” BBQ and/or the formal anniversary dinner. If you still want to purchase meals in the serveries, you can get a guest-meal-card at the porters and top it up with money yourself. Please note that a 10€ deposit is required and that there is only one vending machine (accessible 24/7). Unused money can be withdrawn from the vending machine upon return.

        <strong>Can I get accommodation on campus?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be accommodation available on campus. Both the guest rooms and free rooms in the colleges are reserved. There are 48 single rooms and 8 double rooms which will be given out on a first-come-first-served basis. To register for a double room, please make sure to enter your partner’s name in the respective field under the “Additional Information” in the checkout step of the registration. If the double rooms are sold out, we will try to allocate you in two adjacent single rooms.

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        You can – and possibly should – book accommodation in any hotel there is in Bremen, preferably well advance, as rooms are booked out quickly. We encourage you to also get in touch with your former host family in Bremen. Maybe you can arrange a night or two with them.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The Welcome Packages will be ready at TOS during the Friday night Bar Chill-Out. If you are arriving late, you can also pick them up Saturday morning in the Krupp Servery during breakfast. The package will include your wristband to get your meals from the servery (if you have chosen the “Campus All-In”-option), prints of all schedules and a few surprise goodies;)
