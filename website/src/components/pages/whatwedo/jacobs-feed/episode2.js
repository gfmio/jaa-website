        How to Save Money &amp; Help Jacobs – a 4 Step Guide
      </h2>
      <p>In our last article we went into the details of the outstanding loans and ended with a promise to present you with a concrete approach to minimize your loan burden AND help Jacobs improve their recovery rate at the same time.</p>
      <p>Basically, &nbsp;this is how many of us felt after Graduation when we realized we had that massive outstanding loan:</p>

      <em>Sometimes this is also what mid-term season felt like.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Graduating, looking for a job, and getting into the real world are all daunting challenges. However, they are also a reality everyone of us has to face! Unfortunately, in the process many of us forget about or stop prioritizing the loan we received from Jacobs. While this is bad for the University, its worse for your own wallet. The loan grows and grows until it turns into a mountain you feel you can never overcome. But does it really have to be like this? &nbsp;In fact – not at all! Thanks to very low interest rates, some generous offers from the University and some help from the government you might be done with your loan faster than you expect!</p>

      <strong>Opportunity No. 1: 10 Years Alumni Reunions – 10% Bonanza!</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>Did you know that you can always end the Jacobs tuition postponement earlier than scheduled in the payback plan? And on your last payment – you typically got a 5% discount.</p>
      <p>Now, imagine that you inherit some money, save up a few years after starting to work, win a jackpot, or more realistically – have friends or family who are willing to lend you the cash or can get access to a cheap bank loan (see Opportunity No. 3). In the past – you could use this to pay off your loan at Jacobs in one go and save 5% of the amount in the process. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      <strong> Now, here’s the best part, until the 31st of January 2015, the University is offering a one-time special 10 year reunion offer!</strong>

      <em>You get 10%, you get 10%, you all get 10% (sorry, we’re gifaholics – this wont stop)</em>
      </p>
      <p>What this means is – if you pay up your full Jacobs loan at once before the 31st of January, 2015 – you will get a solid 10% rebate on it. &nbsp;However, check with your tax consultant on how to potentially split this across 2014 and 2015 in order to get maximum savings (see Opportunity 4 for more tax related ideas).</p>
      <p>
      <strong>Opportunity No. 2: Larger Installments</strong>
      </p>
      <p>As you know, Jacobs charges every year 7.75% interest on the amount that you owe the university. By paying back smaller amounts every month than what you could actually sustain and thereby stretching the payment period unnecessarily further, you are in fact hurting yourself. If you manage to pay back your tuition loan in one year, starting right after graduation, Jacobs will charge only once the 7.75%. In comparison, if you pay back everything only after 8 years, Jacobs will charge 7.75% eight times! Admittedly, each time the interest is charged on a smaller face value since you gradually reduce your outstanding debt, but the difference stays large.</p>
      <p>By voluntarily increasing your monthly rate, you can therefore save a lot of cash!</p>
      <p>
      <em>See an example calculation below:</em>
      </p>
      <p class="uk-text-center">
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GKzoE8YOMQF3KTyn1yfhRsBTlgVTMlK2dJ7wT_ops-V8nksAvy4OQZMqEGGRQ0kFvpt5rCjHe6um9UJPGri9RFkQxa42vAon5rfhjjYPLOaWGO4FcYOtj_CsU22GMZ0K2g" />
      </p>
      <p>Yes – that’s a significant amount of cash you can save just by putting a bit more of your savings into your loan every month.</p>

      <p>
      <strong>Opportunity No. 3: Cover the Jacobs loan with a lower interest loan from a local bank (Refinancing)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The Jacobs interest rate reflects the credit risk the University is bearing. Jacobs has had a constant interest rate of 7.75% for everyone. At the time you came to Jacobs, there was no choice but to take that Jacobs tuition postponement. Now, however, you are likely to be in a different position. With a salary income and a positive banking track record over several years (including your account at beloved Sparkasse Bremen), there are now more opportunities to take out a loan from a “normal” bank than when you finished high school. Under the current market conditions interest rate levels are very low, so chances are high that you will find a loan that charges less than the Jacobs 7.75%. (Many German banks for example offer personal loans for as little as 4,5% these days).</p>
      <p>
      <em>See an example calculation below (includes the 10% discount from Opportunity No. 1):</em>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="uk-text-center">

      </p>
      <p>So combining the interest savings from refinancing together with the 10% discount you can effectively save a much larger percentage of your loan – in one go!</p>

      <strong>Opportunity No. 4: Get a tax break</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>Costs that are incurred during a university education are, in many countries, tax deductable. What that means is that the tuition loan payments you are making each year can be substracted from the gross income that will be subject to income tax. That can be a lot of money you can save, especially in countries with high income tax. For Germany that means up to 6000 € that can be claimed for the Bachelor’s, and unlimited amounts for a Master and PhD every year. Just ask a fellow Alumni living in your country or any tax advisor to be sure.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>So what does this all mean?</strong>

      <p>Don’t worry – we got your covered. To better illustrate what all these benefits mean when making use of all opportunities combined, let’s walk you through one comprehensive example and see what’s really in for you.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>Assume the following case:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>– You owe the university a total amount of 15000€.</p>
      <p>– You went on to a Master’s for two years, right after graduation.</p>
      <p>– You had a well-paying student job in the second year of your Master’s.</p>
      <p>– You get a good job in Germany after you graduated and earn an annual salary of 40000€.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
