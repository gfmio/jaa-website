      <p>Dear fellow Alumni,</p>
      <div>&nbsp;<p>
      </p>
      <div>This year’ s homecoming will mark the 10 year existence of our association. Your contribution keeps the Association running. Thank you for that.&nbsp;<p>
      </p>
      <p>Some of our projects are slowly turning into operational business, while new challenges keep us on our feet. One could say, we are slowly growing up.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div>
      <div>With the experience we have gathered over the past years we saw the pressing need to also adapt our Charter in a way that would simplify our way of working together and of facilitating engagement of us as alumni.<p>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, in the past months, we have worked on modifying the Charter of our Alumni Association.</p>
      <p>Some of the aims of the proposed Charter changes consist of</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>decreasing bureaucracy</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>facilitating donations from alumni to the association and the university</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>increasing flexibility to add supporting members to the board</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>simplifying the election process and</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>clearly formulating a framework for streams of income via fees, which were generally approved at the GA of 2008</li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Please note: We have worked on finally being an Association that is non-profit, in German “gemeinnützig”, by law. For this to happen, the preamble of the old Charter had to be deleted.</p>
