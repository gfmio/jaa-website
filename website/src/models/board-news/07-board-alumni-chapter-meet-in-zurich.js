        “Grüezi mitenand” – was the Swiss German welcome of the hosts Stefan Rustler and Elena Isac during this year’s first in person meeting of the Alumni Board on the weekend of 10th – 12th April 2015.

        As it is common for Jacobs Events, the weather was beautiful with sun and almost 20 degrees so that Zurich presented itself from its best side. It couldn’t have been a better day as the board convened at the historic Jacobs House at the invitation of the Jacobs Foundation. Its Head of Operations, Dr. Urs Arnold, shared interesting information on the history as well as current activities of the Foundation. A fantastic opportunity with interesting conversations, also around the future plans of the association.

        All about progress and next steps were the discussion during our board meetings sessions. With a filled pipeline of projects that will be rolled out in the coming weeks and by this year’s reunion, every minute was used in full. Together with the association’s new independence in areas of governance, finances and IT infrastructure, it was these topics that received most attention and energy. This was rounded off with the new Generation Fund and the plans for this year’s reunion. As always, expect more information coming your way in the near future! For those interested in the detailed minutes – they are available for you <a href="/media/board-news/Zürich-11-12-April-2015-Minutes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The Saturday evening topped it all off with a night out with the Zurich Alumni Chapter. With more than 25 alumni at the Kennedy’s Irish Pub it was one of the biggest and successful chapter events so far. With this opportunity at hand, the chapter also nominated two new Alumni Chapter Leaders – congratulations to Alexandru Sava and Sami Galal!
