      <p>The Board of Jacobs University’s Alumni Association held its first meeting of the year in Berlin at the weekend. The German capital is the home of Stefan Anca, Secretary of the Board, and the meeting was hosted by Stefan’s employer Project A Ventures. The Board was joined by Suna Turhan as new Treasurer (not pictured) and Devashish Tikekar as new interim Vice President. The Alumni Office was represented by Imke Sonnenberg, Manager Alumni Relations.</p>
      <p>After the Board briefly caught up on currently running programs, the main focus of the two-day meeting remained on new projects, many of which are related to the current changes at Jacobs University. Axel Domeyer, a representative of the Alumni Consulting Initiative (not in the picture) presented the group’s conceptual plan and the Board discussed a possible integration into the University’s future strategy.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Iliyana Heucke, Class Representative of the Class of 2004, updated the board on the plans for the upcoming 5 and 10 year reunion. For the first time in its history, Jacobs University will host two reuniting classes on campus at the event scheduled for the fall.</p>
      <p>Peter Dabrowski, President of Jacobs University’s Alumni Association says: “The current changes on campus are opening a window of unprecedented opportunity. With the Consulting Initiative the Alumni are directly involved in conceptualizing the University’s new strategy – it’s a corporation that is highly valued from both sides. Also further projects, such as the relaunch of our alumni networking platform, have been successfully kicked off. Although we are facing a lot of work, with a very tight schedule, I am confident we will meet the coming challenges”</p>
