        The old Jacobs Alumni e-mail server, called Mailhost, will be discontinued on Monday 02.11.2015. The old e-mail server was running in parallel with the new Google-hosted Alumni e-mail service since April 2015. What does this mean for us Alumni?

      <p>
        <strong>Are you using the Google web interface to check e-mails?</strong><br/>
        Then nothing changes for you. If you already use the Google interface to check your Alumni emails, then youâ€™re certain that you use the new e-mail server.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Are you using an e-mail client (i.e. Outlook or Thunderbird) to check e-mails?</strong><br/>
        If you check your Alumni e-mail account from an e-mail client, you have to make sure that you are using the correct POP/IMAP settings for the Google-hosted Alumni e-mail.
