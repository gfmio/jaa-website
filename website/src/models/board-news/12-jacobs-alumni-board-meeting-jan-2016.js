        Last week’s Jacobs Alumni Board meeting was probably one of the most fruitful in a long time. Not only did the team advance specific details of the near-to-completion database, but also strengthened its ties with the university. We were joined by our Alma Mater Predrag Tapavicki (Head of Corporate Relations and Talent Management) and Tanja Woebs (Corporate Relations and Talent Programs Officer) on Saturday. We laid out the future cooperation between Jacobs University Bremen and our association to push our database forward in an effective way. Brilliant!

        Given the extra professional legal and IT support we are certain that our database will be up and running for this year’s graduation LATEST. What does that entail for you? Automatic profile updating via LinkedIn login, hands-on access to a fast growing network of alumni working in all kinds of industries and more updates on your beloved home away from home.

      <p>
        Stay tuned for the most exciting year of the Jacobs Alumni Association!
