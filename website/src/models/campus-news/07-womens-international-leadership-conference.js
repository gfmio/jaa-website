        Following a successful conference in Spring 2015, WIL will take place again in April 2016. The conference is organized by a dedicated team of Jacobs students. In spring 2015 the WIL Conference managed to bring together 200 participants from five continents through 19 speakers and workshop instructors from diverse backgrounds, such as politics, business, academia, arts and campaigns for women’s rights. Speakers, participants, cooperation partners as well as the organizers themselves regarded the conference as a huge success.

        WIL is a solely student-led initiative first conceptualized at Jacobs University Bremen by young women aged 18 to 23 from uniquely diverse backgrounds. We want to create a platform for advocacy, dialogue, and inspiration in the interest of advancing women’s role in the professional sphere and contributing to a higher level of gender equality in leadership positions. The conference offers an opportunity for the participants to practice their professional skills during interactive workshops and network with other conference guests and speakers. WIL is not only about, but in itself a step towards more women’s leadership.

        The Women’s International Leadership Conference (WIL) provides a platform for participants across the globe to exchange with inspiring leaders in professional spheres ranging from business, to technology, from science to art and discuss the gender disparity in leadership positions. Through workshops and speeches, participants acquire crucial skills for their future careers and develop solutions to remove barriers to women’s leadership. The close interaction with speakers provided unique networking opportunities for participants, speakers and sponsors.
