        Dear Jacobs Alumni,
      </p>
      <p>
        on behalf of the organization team, the Career Services Center and Alumni Office, as well as on behalf of the Alumni Association and Board, I would like to thank you for making our second Jacobs Career Symposium a full success last Friday evening! It was a wonderful starting point for an amazing alumni homecoming weekend.

        With more than 250 attendees at the Symposium, the Campus Center was full of students, alumni, company representatives, faculty, staff and external guests with an open networking atmosphere J. We hope that you could make some new and refresh your old contacts.
